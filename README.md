# About
Providing machine-readable versions of the Blizzard EULAs (Europe), allowing for easy diff checks between 
versions. 

# Structure
For each new version there is another branch which is named after the month the version was released. Please 
note that due to changes to the conversion the branches before november 2022 are a bit different, so automatic 
diff checking is not perfectly working with them.  

To compare two branches, clone the repo and use `git diff` to show the changes between the versions. 

# Contributing
If you have access to any EULAs that are not yet in this repository feel free to add them. 

# Disclaimer
I don't have explicit rights to use the EULA, but since it is available online anyway I guess this should be no problem.
