# About
Providing machine-readable versions of the Blizzard EULAs, allowing for easy diff checks between versions. 

# To-Do
* structuring EULAs and diff-files
* automate diff

# Contributing
If you have access to any EULAs that are not yet in this repository feel free to add them. 

# Disclaimer
I don't have explicit rights to use the EULA, but since it is available online anyway I guess this should be no problem.
