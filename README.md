# About
Providing machine-readable versions of the Blizzard EULAs (Europe), allowing for easy diff checks between 
versions. 

## how to use
Whenever I get a new prompt to review the EULA (or similar legal notice) changes, I create a new branch and 
add all relevant documents here. The idea is to use the git tools to create diffs of the branches and compare 
new changes this way.

# Contributing
If you have access to any EULAs that are not yet in this repository feel free to add them. 

# Disclaimer
I don't have explicit rights to use the EULA, but since it is available online anyway I guess this should be no problem. 

# Note
The structure of this repository has been changed after this version of the EULA was added, so there might be 
some formal diffs.
