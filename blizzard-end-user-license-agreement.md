**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**

 

**YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT (THE "AGREEMENT") BEFORE
INSTALLING OR USING BLIZZARD'S ONLINE GAMING PLATFORM. IF YOU DO NOT
AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL OR
OTHERWISE ACCESS THE PLATFORM.**

 

You must be and hereby affirm that you are an adult of the legal age of
majority in your country and state of residence. **If you are under the
legal age of majority, your parent or legal guardian must consent to
this Agreement.**

 

Thank you for your interest in Blizzard's online gaming services and
interactive games, and the interactive games from other developers
("Licensors") who make their games available through the Battle.net
gaming service's Platform. (Blizzard's and the Licensors' games are
collectively referred to herein as the "Games"). This Agreement sets
forth the terms and conditions under which you are licensed to install
and use the Platform, and it governs other aspects of the relationship
between you and Blizzard as set forth below. As used in this Agreement,
the term "Platform" refers collectively, and at times individually, to
(1) the Battle.net desktop app software, (2) the Battle.net gaming
service, (3) each of the Games, (4) authorized Mobile Apps relating to
the Games and the Battle.net game service, and (5) all features and
components of each of them, whether installed or used on a computer,
console, or mobile device.

 

Your use of the Platform is licensed, not sold, to you, and you hereby
acknowledge that no title or ownership with respect to the Platform or
the Games is being transferred or assigned and this Agreement should not
be construed as a sale of any rights. All access to and use of the
Platform and the Games is subject to this Agreement, the applicable
software documentation, our [Privacy
Policy](https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/a4380ee5-5c8d-4e3b-83b7-ea26d01a9918/blizzard-entertainment-online-privacy-policy),
any other documentation referred to in this Agreement which expressly
states it is incorporated into this Agreement, and when applicable, any
Licensor's terms (collectively, the "Complete Terms"). The Complete
Terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference (with
this Agreement controlling any conflicting terms), and represent the
complete Agreement between you and us relating to use of the Platform,
the Games, and related services and products, superseding any prior
Agreements between you and us, whether written or oral.

 

In the event of conflict between this Agreement and any Licensor's
terms, see Section 1.B.v.5 below.

 

If you've made a purchase through Battle.net® or the Battle.net® Shop,
our Terms of Sale govern such purchases and you should review those
terms carefully. In any case of conflict between this Agreement and the
Terms of Sale, the Terms of Sale will take precedence.

 

Subject to the other provisions in this Agreement, this Agreement is
applicable for those resident in Europe, the Middle East or Africa.

 

Except as otherwise provided below, if you reside within Europe, Middle
East or Africa and are accessing the Platform, use of the Platform is
licensed to you by Activision Blizzard UK Limited, having its registered
office at The Ampersand Building, 178 Wardour Street, London, W1F 8FY,
United Kingdom (referred to herein as "Blizzard", "we," or "us").

 

1.  **The Platform.**
    1.  **The Battle.net Account.** To use the Platform, you may be
        required to register, or have previously registered, a
        Battle.net Account (an "Account"). Certain Games may not require
        creation of an Account. Use of the Games, and creation and use
        of Accounts are subject to the following terms and conditions:
        1.  You may establish an Account only if: (i) you are a "natural
            person" and an adult in your country and state of residence
            (Corporations, Limited Liability Companies, partnerships and
            other legal or business entities may not establish an
            Account); and (ii) you are not an individual specifically
            prohibited by Blizzard from using the Platform.
        2.  When you create or update an Account, you must:
            1.  provide Blizzard with accurate and up to date
                information that is personal to you, such as, but not
                limited to, your name and email address. Additionally,
                in order to play certain Games or use certain features
                offered on the Platform, you may also be required to
                provide Blizzard with payment information (such as
                credit card information). Blizzard's retention and/or
                use of your personal information is subject to
                Blizzard's Privacy Policy, located at
                <https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/8c41e7e6-0b61-42c4-a674-c91d8e8d68d3/blizzard-entertainment-privacy-policy>
                (the terms of which are incorporated into this
                Agreement). Blizzard will also have the right to obtain
                non-personal data from your connection to the Platform;
                and
            2.  select a unique username and password (collectively
                referred to hereunder as "Login Information"). You may
                not use your real name as the password for the Account,
                and you cannot share the Account or the Login
                Information with anyone, unless the terms of this
                Agreement allow it.
        3.  To play Games, you may need to add a Game license to an
            Account, which may require an authentication code generated
            by Blizzard. For Game licenses purchased at retail, the
            authentication code will either be included in the packaging
            materials or sent to you via electronic means. If you
            purchase or download a Game digitally from Blizzard or via
            an authorized mobile app store (e.g., Apple or Google), the
            authentication code will be assigned to the Account when you
            purchase or download the Game.
        4.  Please take a few moments to review Blizzard's Account
            Security information available here:
            <https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/14319>. You must
            maintain the confidentiality of the Login Information, as
            you are responsible for all uses of the Login Information
            and the Account, including purchases, whether or not
            authorized by you. If you become aware of or reasonably
            suspect any breach of security, including without limitation
            any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of the Login
            Information, you must immediately notify Blizzard at
            <https://support.blizzard.com/>. Blizzard, in its sole
            discretion, may require additional information and/or
            documentation to verify your claim, and once Blizzard has
            the information that Blizzard deems necessary to verify your
            claim, Blizzard will take actions to freeze your Account
            until Blizzard has returned control of your Account to you.
            Regardless of any actions Blizzard may take on your behalf,
            you acknowledge and agree that Blizzard has sole and
            absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim
            is valid and, if so, the appropriate remedy.
        5.  Subject to the laws of your country of residence, minors may
            utilize an Account established or play a Game installed by
            their parent or legal guardian upon the parent/guardian's
            acceptance of this Agreement. In the event that you permit
            your minor child or legal ward (collectively, your "Child")
            to use an Account or the Platform (including any Game), you
            hereby agree to this Agreement on behalf of yourself and
            your Child, and you understand and agree that you will be
            responsible for all uses of the Account or the Platform by
            your Child whether or not any particular use was authorized
            by you.
        6.  If you make an in-game purchase accessed via PlayStation®4,
            it will be purchased from Sony Interactive Entertainment
            Network Europe Limited ("SIENE") and be subject to
            PlayStation™Network Terms of Service and User Agreement
            which is available on the PlayStation™Store. Please check
            usage rights for each purchase as these may differ from item
            to item. Unless otherwise shown, content available in any
            in-game store has the same age rating as the game.
        7.  Your use of the Platform to interact with Blizzard and other
            players is governed by Blizzard's in-Game Code of Conduct
            accessible
            [here](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/42673) (the
            "Code of Conduct"). The Code of Conduct is not meant to be
            exhaustive. The Code of Conduct is incorporated into this
            Agreement by this reference and is available at:
            <https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/42673> Please note
            that violation of any of Blizzard's Codes of Conduct
            (including with regard to Your use of Blizzard's Websites
            and Forums) may result in penalties against your Battle.net
            Account, including suspension and/or termination of Game
            licenses.
        8.  You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by
            you or anyone using your Account. If you choose a recurring
            subscription for a Game, you acknowledge that payments will
            be processed automatically (e.g., debited from your Blizzard
            Balance or charged to your credit card) until you cancel the
            subscription or the Account.
        9.  Blizzard may revise the pricing for the goods and services
            offered through the Platform at any time with a reasonable
            prior notice. If Blizzard modifies its subscription fees,
            Blizzard will send you an email notification at least
            thirty (30) days before the price modifications become live.
            The new price will only be applicable to you from the date
            of your subscription renewal. Your continued use after the
            renewal of your current subscription period means that you
            accept the updated subscription fees. If you disagree with
            those price modifications, you may cancel your subscription
            by clicking the "cancel account" button on the subscription
            management page in your Battle.net Account before the
            subscription period with the modified price starts. Your
            cancellation has to be made before the price changes come
            into force, otherwise you will be deemed to have accepted
            those modifications. If you are resident in Germany, we will
            send you an email notification at least six (6) weeks before
            the price modifications become live.
        10. For customers who purchased subscriptions which commenced:
            1.  prior to the date in which this Agreement was last
                revised, as set out above (the "Effective Date") and

                fees, charges and applicable taxes for such

        Section 1.C below, as follows:
        1.  You may install applicable components or features of the
            Platform (including the Games) on one or more computers or
            mobile devices under your legitimate control.
        2.  You may use the Platform for your personal and
            non-commercial entertainment purposes only, unless
            specifically allowed under the terms of this Agreement.
        3.  You may not transfer your rights and obligations to use the
            Platform.
        4.  With regards to Games purchased from retailers on original
            media (e.g., on CD-ROM, DVD, etc.) you may permanently
            transfer all of your rights and obligations related to the
            use of a Game under this Agreement to another person who
            agrees to the terms of this Agreement by physically
            transferring the original media, original packaging, and all
            manuals or other documentation distributed with the Game
            provided that you permanently delete all copies and
            installations of the Game in your possession or control. You
            agree to be solely responsible for any taxes, fees, charges,
            duties, withholdings, assessments, and the like, together
            with any interest, penalties, and additions imposed in
            connection with such transfer. Other than as set forth
            above, Blizzard does not recognize any purported transfer of
            the Games.
        5.  Some of the Games may be subject to specific license terms
            that may include the following:
            1.  Trial or "Starter" versions of Games allow you to play a
                limited version of the Game before you will be required
                to purchase a Game license. Licenses to use the full
                version of these Games can be purchased through the
                Platform.
            2.  In certain cases, the "full version," of Games can only
                be played after you purchase and add a Game license to
                your Account.
            3.  You may only play the Game(s) you obtained a license for
                at authorized publicly-available cyber cafés or computer
                gaming centers on the Platform through an Account
                registered to you. You will be informed of any
                requirement to purchase a license before you can use a
                Game, and of any time limitations that would affect how
                long you can play a Game.
            4.  Certain Games may be obtained through the Platform, but
                may not be playable on the Platform. In such an event,
                the Game will be provided with a separate End User
                License Agreement that will govern your installation and
                use of the Game post purchase.
            5.  For Games which are produced by Blizzard's Licensors and
                distributed through, and/or played upon, the Platform
                may require that you agree to the Licensor's End User
                License Agreement and that you acknowledge other terms,
                such as Licensor's privacy policy and terms of use,
                prior to your being able to play the Game on the
                Platform. The terms and conditions of Licensor's End
                User License Agreement are hereby incorporated into this
                Agreement by this reference. In the event of a conflict
                between the terms of this Agreement and a Licensor's End
                User License Agreement pertaining to the use of the
                Licensor's Game, the Licensor's End User License
                Agreement will supersede and govern your use of the
                Licensor's Game. However, in the event of a conflict
                between the terms of this Agreement and the Licensor's
                End User License Agreement pertaining to any other
                aspect of the Platform, this Agreement will supersede
                and govern your use of the Platform.
    3.  **License Limitations.** Blizzard may suspend or terminate your
        license to use the Platform, or parts, components and/or single
        features thereof, as mentioned in Section 10.B hereunder if you
        do not comply with the Agreement, the Code of Conduct and other
        applicable terms mentioned in this Agreement, and/or if you
        violate, or assist others in violating, the specific license
        limitations set forth below. In case of such a license
        suspension or termination you will not be entitled to any
        compensation in regard to the respective suspended or terminated
        license, including but not limited to game subscriptions,
        in-game items, currencies and services, tokens, etc. You agree
        that you will not, in whole or in part or under any
        circumstances, do the following:
        1.  **Derivative Works**: Copy or reproduce (except as provided
            in Section 1.B.), translate, reverse engineer, derive source
            code from, modify, disassemble, decompile, or create
            derivative works based on or related to the Platform.
        2.  **Cheating**: Create, use, offer, promote, advertise, make
            available and/or distribute the following or assist therein:
            1.  cheats; i.e. methods not expressly authorized by
                Blizzard (whether accomplished using hardware, software,
                a combination thereof, or otherwise), influencing and/or
                facilitating the gameplay, including exploits of any
                in-game bugs, and thereby granting you and/or any other
                user an advantage over other players not using such
                methods;
            2.  bots; i.e. any code and/or software, not expressly
                authorized by Blizzard, that allows the automated

                the region associated with the Account that you have
                registered. The Global Play feature requires that some
                or all of your personal information provided to Blizzard
                when you registered the Account be transferred to
                servers operated by Blizzard in the regions where you
                wish to play the Game. By agreeing to participate in
                Global Play, you agree that Blizzard can transfer your
                data to Blizzard's servers in each of the regions that
                you select to participate in using the Global Play
                feature. For more information, please review Blizzard's

                (the terms of which are incorporated into this
                Agreement).
            2.  **Battle.net Balance**.
                1.  As an active Account holder, you may participate in
                    Battle.net Balance service ("Battle.net Balance").
                    Battle.net Balance can only be used to obtain
                    certain products and services offered by Blizzard;
                    it has no cash value. Blizzard grants you a limited
                    license to acquire, use, and redeem Battle.net
                    Balance pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
                    Regardless of how it is acquired, Battle.net Balance
                    is non-transferable to another person or Account,
                    does not accrue interest, is not insured by any
                    government entity, and, unless otherwise required by
                    law or permitted by this Agreement, is not
                    redeemable or refundable for any sum of money or
                    monetary value from Blizzard at any time. The
                    Battle.net Balance may be terminated in accordance
                    with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
                    when we cease providing the software, or this
                    Agreement is otherwise terminated. Battle.net
                    Balance does not constitute a personal property
                    right. Battle.net Balance is not a bank account.
                    And, while you can register and play on multiple
                    Battle.net Accounts, you are not allowed to have
                    more than three (3) Accounts with Battle.net

                    Battle.net Balance are made available on your
                    Account for your use. Certain minimums may apply to
                    purchases when adding Battle.net Balance to your

                    Balance for certain goods and/or services offered on
                    the Platform. TO HAVE A BATTLE.NET BALANCE OF MORE
                    THAN A CERTAIN VALUE, YOU MUST HAVE ATTACHED AN
                    AUTHENTICATOR TO YOUR BATTLE.NET ACCOUNT. In order
                    to check the applicable value for your currency, go
                    to <https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/25904>.
                    Blizzard reserves the right to change the value
                    limitation at any time. You can download the
                    Blizzard Authenticator for mobile devices at
                    <https://battle.net/account/management/authenticator.html>.
                    Blizzard will not send you a statement of itemized
                    transactions on the Account. In order to check the
                    Battle.net Balance loaded on the Account, or review
                    recent transactions on the Account, go to
                    <https://eu.battle.net/account/management/transaction-history.html>
                4.  You are responsible for all Battle.net Balance
                    transactions, including unauthorized transactions.
                5.  You are responsible for all uses of your Battle.net
                    Balance. If you suspect that the Account has been
                    compromised, you should contact Blizzard customer
                    service immediately at
                    <http://eu.blizzard.com/support/webform.xml>.
                    Battle.net Balance will only be protected from the
                    point that Blizzard issues a message to you
                    indicating that Blizzard has received your notice
                    that the Account may have been compromised. You are
                    solely responsible for verifying that the proper
                    amount of Battle.net Balance has been added to or
                    deducted from your Account. You can view your
                    Battle.net Balance from your account management
                    page. Note that we may require additional
                    information and/or documentation to verify your
                    claim. From that point forward, Blizzard will take
                    actions to freeze your Battle.net Balance, and will
                    unfreeze your Battle.net Balance once Blizzard has
                    returned control of your Battle.net Balance to you.
                6.  Blizzard reserves the right to reduce, liquidate,
                    deactivate, suspend or terminate any Battle.net
                    Balance added to the Account or access to Battle.net
                    Balance or other Platform features if Blizzard
                    determines, after investigation and in accordance
                    with Section 10.B below, that you have violated this
                    Agreement, including the license limitations set
                    forth in Section 1.C., misused Battle.net Balance,
                    or have otherwise used Battle.net Balance to conduct
                    any fraudulent or illegal activity. If you are
                    resident in Germany, the terms in sub-section
                    'Account' in Section 13 will apply instead of this
                    Section 1.D.i.2.f.
                7.  In the event that you are in any way responsible for
                    compromising Accounts, Blizzard retains the right to
                    remove Battle.net Balance from the Account gained
                    through compromising other Accounts, suspending
                    access to any services provided to you by Blizzard,
                    such as access to in-Game auction houses and/or
                    terminating the Account, subject to the terms of
                    Section 10.B below.
            3.  **Advertising**. The Platform may incorporate
                third-party technology that enables advertising on the
                Platform and/or in certain Games playable on the
                Platform, which may be downloaded temporarily to your
                personal computer and replaced during online game play.
                As part of this process, Blizzard and/or its authorized
                third-party advertisers may collect standard information
                that is sent when your personal computer connects to the
                Internet including your Internet protocol (IP) address.
            4.  **User Created or Uploaded Content**. The Platform may
                provide you an opportunity to upload and display content
                on the Platform, such as on the Blizzard forums, and/or
                as part of a Game, including the compilation,
                arrangement or display of such content (collectively,
                the "User Content"). User Content specifically does not
                include a Custom Game, as defined in Section 1.D.ii.1.

                hereby grant Blizzard a perpetual (or for the maximum
                period of time permitted under applicable law),
                irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid up, non-exclusive,

                User Content as well as all modified and derivative
                works thereof and any and all elements contained
                therein, and use or incorporate a portion or portions of
                the User Content or the elements thereof in conjunction
                with or into any other material. If you are resident in
                the European Economic Area, nothing in this paragraph is
                intended to affect your statutory rights regarding our
                use of User Content on the termination of your Agreement
                with us. You represent and warrant that the User Content
                does not infringe upon the copyright, trademark, patent,
                trade secret or other intellectual property and/or
                personality rights of any third party. You further
                represent and warrant that you will not use or
                contribute User Content that is unlawful, tortious,

                or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate. Blizzard
                may remove any User Content and any related content or

                hereby agree not to be identified as the author of the
                User Content. In the event you upload or otherwise
                transmit to Blizzard any concepts, ideas, or feedback

                any compensation for any such submission, unless
                expressly agreed between you and Blizzard, and Blizzard
                may freely use any such submission in any manner it
                deems appropriate. Any such submission by you will not
                create any contractual relationship between you and
                Blizzard. Except to the extent that any such waiver is
                prohibited by law, you hereby waive the benefit of any
                provision of law known as \"moral rights\" or \"droit
                moral\" or any similar law in any country of the world.
                Depending on the content, additional Terms may apply.
            5.  **Real ID Feature and Identity Disclosure**. The
                Platform allows you to disclose your real identity to
                other users of the Platform through the "Real ID
                Friends" feature. If you use the Real ID feature and
                opt-in to a request to be "Real ID Friends" with another
                user, that user will be able to see your real name and
                online status. If you are a parent or legal guardian and
                if you provide your approval to allow your minor child
                to use your Account, please be aware that your child may
                opt in to the Real ID feature. YOU OPT-IN TO THE REAL ID
                FEATURE, THOSE PEOPLE YOU DESIGNATE AS A "REAL ID
                FRIEND" WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE NAMES OF YOUR OTHER
                "REAL ID FRIENDS," AND YOUR NAME AND ONLINE STATUS WILL
                BE VISIBLE BY THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOUR "REAL ID FRIENDS"
                HAVE DESIGNATED USING THE SAME FEATURE. You may opt out
                of the Real ID feature in your Batte.net Account
                settings at any time by deleting all Real ID Friends
                from your Account.
            6.  **Blizzard Television Service**: Upon your association
                of a World of Warcraft or StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty
                Game license with your Account, or by ordering any
                online services related to World of Warcraft or
                StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, you will receive as part
                of the fees paid for the online services, access to the
                online game(s) and access to a television service (ESL
                Turtle TV), which is an IP TV service featuring, among
                other content, Blizzard games, Blizzard products and
                other Blizzard related content.
        2.  **Game Features.**
            1.  **Game Editors**. Certain Games include editing software
                (hereafter referred as "Game Editor(s)") that will allow
                you to create custom games, levels, maps, scenarios or
                other content ("Custom Games"). For purposes of this
                Agreement and any Agreements referenced herein, "Custom
                Games" includes all content created using the Game
                Editor(s), including but not limited to all digital
                files associated with such Custom Games, as well as (1)
                all content contained within such files, including but
                not limited to player and non-player characters, audio
                and video elements, environments, objects, items, skins,
                and textures, (2) all titles, trademarks, trade names,
                character names, or other names and phrases associated
                with or included within the Custom Game, and (3) any
                other intellectual property rights contained within the
                Custom Game, including any and all content, game
                concepts, methods or ideas. A Custom Game may only be
                used with the Game's engine that is associated with a
                particular Game Editor. The manner in which Custom Games
                can be used or exploited is set forth in the [Custom
                Game Acceptable Use
                Policy](http://blizzard.com/en-gb/company/legal/acceptable-use.html),
                the terms of which are incorporated into this Agreement
                by this reference, and which can be found at
                <http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/company/legal/acceptable-use.html>.
                Blizzard may modify, remove, disable, or delete Custom
                Games at any time in its sole and absolute discretion.
            2.  **Community Tournaments**. In order to support local
                esports tournament activities, Blizzard provides a
                license program for organizers of community tournaments
                under its Community Competition license, which can be
                found at
                <https://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/company/legal/community-competition-license.html>.
            3.  **Beta Testing Pre-Release Versions of Games**. Certain
                pre-release versions of Games may be made available to
                you through the Platform for testing ("Beta Test"). Your
                participation in a Beta Test through the Platform will
                be governed by the following:
                1.  **Eligibility**. In order to participate in a Beta
                    Test, you must meet the following requirements:
                    1.  Blizzard must designate you to participate in a
                        Beta Test (a "Beta Tester");
                    2.  The Account that you will use to participate in
                        the Beta Test must be in good standing;
                    3.  If the Beta Test is to test an expansion to a
                        Game, then the Account must be upgraded with all
                        previous expansions to that particular Game;
                    4.  You agree to allow Blizzard to obtain hardware
                        and software information from the computer
                        system that you will use to take part in the
                        Beta Test (the "Beta Test System") prior to
                        registration for the Beta Test in order for
                        Blizzard to determine if you are eligible to
                        participate in the Beta Test; and
                    5.  The Beta Test System must meet the
                        specifications which Blizzard determines are
                        required for the Beta Test.
                2.  **Confidentiality**. If Blizzard announces that a
                    Beta Test is confidential, the Beta Test invitation
                    you will receive will include a notice that states
                    that the Beta Test is confidential. During a
                    confidential Beta Test, the existence of the Beta
                    Test and all elements thereof will be kept
                    confidential, and you agree to keep everything
                    related to the Beta Test secret from everyone who is
                    not participating in the Beta Test until Blizzard
                    informs you that the Beta Test is no longer
                    confidential. For purposes of example and not
                    limitation, you agree that you will not disclose the
                    following during a confidential Beta Test:
                    1.  Information about the Beta Test, such as your
                        role as a Beta Tester, the length of the Beta
                        Test, the number of Beta Testers, how you became
                        a Beta Tester, etc.
                    2.  Information related to the Game that you are
                        Beta Testing, such as the Game's look and feel,
                        playable races, classes, combat, magic,
                        communication, grouping, questing, monetary
                        systems, non-player character interaction,
                        items, armor, weapons, stability of the Game,
                        etc.
                3.  **Beta Tests and Real Money Features**. Certain
                    Games may have features that will allow you to
                    purchase licenses to use digital items or services
                    through the Game's interface. If you purchase a
                    license to use a digital item or service through the
                    Game's interface during a Beta Test, all purchases
                    are subject to the Terms of Sale. Blizzard will not
                    provide you with a refund for your purchase of a
                    digital item or service, and in some cases, items or
                    services purchased during a Beta Test may not
                    transition to the retail release version of a Game.
                    In those cases, Blizzard will provide you with
                    information that explains what, if any, credit you
                    would receive for your purchase of digital goods or
                    services for real money during a Beta Test once the
                    Beta Test has concluded.
                4.  **Feedback**. During and after the Beta Test, you
                    may be provided with an opportunity to give Blizzard
                    your comments, suggestions and impressions of the
                    Game by using tools to supply feedback and bug
                    reports, internal websites and forums, and other
                    methods. The Game may also include a tool that will
                    allow your computer system to forward system and
                    driver information to Blizzard in the event of a
                    crash. This tool will collect data from your
                    computer system related to the crash, and allow you
                    to forward a report to Blizzard via electronic mail.
                5.  **Acknowledgments**. You acknowledge that:
                    1.  the Game being Beta Tested is a work in progress

                    3.  you have the resources necessary to easily
                        reinstall the Beta Test System's operating
                        system and restore any and all data that may be
                        lost;
                    4.  Blizzard is not liable in any way for the loss
                        of data or damage to the Beta Test System,
                        interruptions in service, software or hardware
                        failures, or loss of data or disruption of
                        service;
                    5.  Blizzard may monitor and record any and all

                        postings, etc.;
                    6.  Blizzard may delete or modify the information

                        duration of the Beta Test;
                    7.  Blizzard may transfer software program files to
                        the Beta Test System, including a program that
                        will collect and send Blizzard CPU, RAM,
                        operating system, video card, and sound card
                        information from the Beta Test System; and
                    8.  You may not sell, transfer or commercially
                        exploit access to a Beta, including the
                        distribution of Beta keys without Blizzard's
                        express authorization.
                6.  **Termination**. Blizzard can terminate a Beta Test
                    at any time. When Blizzard terminates a Beta Test,
                    you must delete the pre-release version of the Game
                    that was the subject of the Beta Test and all
                    documents and materials you received from Blizzard
                    in connection with the Beta Test, and you may be
                    asked by Blizzard to remove any elements of the Beta
                    from any hard drives on which the pre-release
                    version of the Game that was the subject of the Beta
                    Test has been installed. You agree and acknowledge
                    that Blizzard's termination of the Beta Test will
                    not be grounds for any refunds of any kind,
                    including, but not limited to, digital items,
                    refunds for time purchased to access World of
                    Warcraft, etc.
                7.  **Sections of the Agreement Applicable to Beta
                    Tests**. When participating in a Beta Test, the
                    terms of this Section 1.D.ii.3. will supersede and
                    govern over any other Section of this Agreement
                    which may be in conflict with the terms of this
                    Section 1.D.ii.3. Additionally, Section 1.B.iv.3. of
                    the Agreement is specifically excluded from the use
                    of a Beta.
    5.  **Alterations to the Platform.**
        1.  Patches and Updates: Blizzard may update the Platform or
            part of the Platform, including Games, in order to, for
            example, without limitation:
            1.  ensure compliance with applicable laws and/or reflect
                change in relevant laws and regulatory requirements;
            2.  perform temporary maintenance, fix bugs, implement
                technical adjustments, and make improvements;
            3.  update or upgrade the Platform including updating the
                structure, design, or layout of the Platform;
            4.  balance, improve, update, or renew a Game;
            5.  ensure the security of the Platform; and
            6.  to combat illegal and/or harmful activities and the use
                of unauthorized programs or other activities which
                breach this Agreement.
        2.  Unless otherwise required by applicable laws and provided
            that any such updates do not result in material derogation
            in the functionality of the Platform:
            1.  You hereby grant to Blizzard consent to deploy and apply
                such patches, updates, and modifications; and
            2.  We may update the Platform remotely without notifying
                you.
        3.  If you are resident in a country in the European Economic
            Area: If any updates to the Platform result in a negative
            impact to your access or use of the Platform in a more than
            minor way, we will give you notice of such changes. If you
            don't agree to the changes, you will be able to terminate
            your Agreement with us within 30 days from the date of any
            notice we provide, or 30 days from when the change comes
            into effect, whichever is later. You may also be able to
            receive a proportionate refund for any aspects of the
            Platform, including Games paid for but not received. Please
            visit <https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/> for more
            information. If you do not object to the changes or
            terminate the Agreement within the stated time limit, we
            will take that as your acceptance of the changes. If you are
            resident in Germany, the terms in the sub-section 'Patches
            and Updates' in Section 13 will apply instead of Sections
            1.B.i - 1.B.iii.
        4.  You understand that some additional storage space may be
            necessary to install Patches and Updates.
        5.  You understand that if you do not install the Patches and
            Updates in accordance with the instructions we provide to
            you (and we have informed you of the consequences of not
            installing the Patches and Updates), you may lose access to
            all or certain functionality in the Platform and we will not
            be liable for any malfunction or error to the Platform
            caused by your failure to install the Patches and Updates.
        6.  You are responsible for any and all broadband or network
            access and usage fees necessary to access and use the
            Platform.

            Account will inure to Blizzard's benefit. Blizzard does not
            recognize the transfer of Accounts. You may not purchase,
            sell, gift or trade any Account, or offer to purchase, sell,
            gift, or trade any Account, and any such attempt will be
            null and void and may result in the forfeiture of the
            Account;
        8.  All Moral Rights that relate to the Platform, including
            Custom Games derived from a Blizzard Game, such as the right
            of attribution, and the right to the integrity of certain
            original works of authorship; and
        9.  The right to create derivative works, and as part of this
            Agreement, you agree that you will not create any work based
            on the Platform, except as expressly set forth in this
            Agreement or otherwise by Blizzard in certain contest rules,
            Terms and Conditions of Fan Art Submissions to Blizzard
            Entertainment (the terms of which are incorporated into this
            Agreement), Blizzard Video Policy or addenda to this
            Agreement.

3.  **Pre-Loaded Software.** The Platform may contain additional
    software that requires you to agree to additional terms prior to
    your use thereof ("Additional Software").

    1.  **Installation.** You agree that Blizzard may install Additional
        Software on your hard drive as part of the installation of the
        Platform, and from time to time during the term of this
        Agreement.
    2.  **Use.** Unless Blizzard grants you a valid license and
        alphanumeric key to use and activate the Additional Software,
        you may not access, use, distribute, copy, display, reverse
        engineer, derive source code from, modify, disassemble,
        decompile or create derivative works based on the Additional
        Software. In the event that Blizzard grants to you a valid
        license and alphanumeric key to use and activate the Additional
        Software, all use of the Additional Software will be subject to
        the terms of this Agreement. If you uninstall any Additional
        Software, you acknowledge that your access to the Platform may
        be impacted and, in some cases, you may not be able to access
        the Platform at all.
    3.  **Copies.** You may make one (1) copy of the Additional Software
        for archival purposes only.

4.  **Consent to Monitor.** WHILE RUNNING, THE PLATFORM (INCLUDING A
    GAME) MAY MONITOR YOUR COMPUTER, CONSOLE OR MOBILE DEVICE\'S MEMORY
    FOR UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS RUNNING EITHER CONCURRENTLY
    WITH A GAME OR OUT OF PROCESS. AN \"UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY
    PROGRAM\" AS USED HEREIN SHALL BE DEFINED AS ANY THIRD PARTY
    SOFTWARE PROHIBITED BY SECTION 1.C. ABOVE. IN THE EVENT THAT THE
    PLATFORM DETECTS AN UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM, (a) THE
    PLATFORM MAY COMMUNICATE INFORMATION BACK TO BLIZZARD, INCLUDING
    WITHOUT LIMITATION YOUR ACCOUNT NAME, DETAILS ABOUT THE UNAUTHORIZED
    THIRD PARTY PROGRAM DETECTED, AND THE TIME AND DATE; AND/OR (b)
    BLIZZARD MAY EXERCISE ANY OR ALL OF ITS RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT,
    WITH OR WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE TO THE USER. Additionally, certain
    Games include a tool that will allow your computer system to forward
    information to Blizzard in the event that the Game crashes,
    including system and driver data, and by agreeing hereto you consent
    to Blizzard receiving and/or using this data.

5.  **Limited Warranty.**

    1.  For residents of the European Economic Area and the United
        Kingdom, your statutory warranties apply as per applicable local
        law. For residents of the European Economic Area, your local
        laws may also provide you with a legal guarantee that the
        Platform will be in legal conformity at the time of supply and
        during the life of this contract with you. Under this legal
        guarantee, we will be liable for lack of conformity of the
        Platform and you may have a right under your local laws to: (i)
        have the Platform brought back into conformity; or (ii) a
        proportionate refund and/or termination of this Agreement.
        Please visit <http://eu.support.blizzard.com/en-gb> for further
        information. If you are resident in France, the terms in Section
        14 apply with respect to your legal guarantees for the Platform.
    2.  For any residents outside the European Economic Area and the
        United Kingdom, the following applies: the platform is provided
        on an "as is" and "as available" basis for your use, without
        warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without
        limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
        particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and those arising
        from course of dealing or usage of trade. Blizzard does not
        warrant that you will be able to access or use the platform at
        the times or locations of your choosing; that the platform will
        be uninterrupted or error-free; that defects will be corrected;
        or that the game client or the platform are free of viruses or
        other harmful components.

6.  **Limitations of Liability.**

    1.  Nothing in these Terms will limit Blizzard's liability for:
        1.  for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence
            or that of our employees or agents;
        2.  our wilful misconduct;
        3.  fraud or make fraudulent misrepresentation;
        4.  for gross negligence; or
        5.  any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under
            applicable law.
    2.  Subject to Section 6.A. above, Blizzard will not be liable for
        any indirect, consequential, unforeseeable or punitive damages
        or for any loss of business, loss of profit, loss of income or
        revenue, loss of anticipated savings or loss of data howsoever
        arising. Blizzard will not be liable for damages arising from
        this Agreement or your use of the Platform resulting from a
        fault or negligence from yourself or because of an event that is
        outside our reasonable control (for more information, see
        Section 13.E. below).
    3.  Subject to Sections 6.A. and 6.B. above, we are not responsible
        for:
        1.  losses or harm not caused by our breach of this Agreement or
            our negligence;
        2.  any damage that may be caused to any device or equipment on
            which you access or use any of our Platform that is caused
            in any way by our Platform unless that damage is directly
            caused by our failure to exercise reasonable skill and care
            in the provision of the Platform;
        3.  any loss or damage resulting from your breach of this
            Agreement;
        4.  any use by you of the Platform which isn't authorised by us
            under this Agreement;
        5.  any lack of functionality or failure to provide any part of
            the Platform that is due to:
            1.  malfunctions or faults in your chosen equipment,
                devices, operating system, or internet connection
                (including malware, viruses or bugs originating from
                third parties or any of your devices); or
            2.  your failure to download or install any update or the
                most recent published version of a Game or Platform in
                order to benefit from updated functionality or to meet
                compatibility requirements, where we have informed you
                of the update, explained the consequences of failing to
                install the update, and provided installation
                instructions; and
        6.  any lack of functionality or incompatibility where your
            chosen equipment, devices, operating system or internet
            connection does not meet the specific requirements provided
            by us.

7.  **Indemnity.** You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Blizzard
    harmless from any claim, demand, damages or other losses, including
    reasonable attorneys' fees, asserted by any third-party resulting
    from or arising out of your use of the Platform, or any breach by
    you of this Agreement, or any Game-specific Terms of Use; however,
    the foregoing does not apply if the infringement of rights is not
    attributable to your intentional or negligent behavior.

8.  **Equitable Remedies.** You hereby agree that Blizzard would be
    irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not
    specifically followed and enforced, and therefore you agree that we
    will be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages,
    to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of the
    Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise
    have available to us under applicable laws.

9.  **Modification of the Agreement.** Blizzard may, from time to time,
    change or modify this Agreement as its business and the law evolves.
    In this case, Blizzard will notify you of any such changes or
    modifications by providing reasonable notice as required under
    applicable law. Your continued use of the Platform after the time
    period specified in the notice will mean that you accept the amended
    Agreement. Those changes or modifications will not affect essential
    characteristics of the Platform. Should you have any questions or
    concerns, please contact Blizzard Customer Service. If you are
    resident in Germany, the terms in sub-section 'Modification of
    Agreement in Section 13 will apply instead of this Section 9.

10. **Term and Termination and Sanctions.**

    1.  **Term.** This Agreement is effective upon your creation of an
        Account, and will remain in effect until it is terminated or
        superseded by a New Agreement, or, if neither of the foregoing
        events occur, as long as you continue using the Platform. In the
        event that Blizzard chooses to cease providing the Platform,
        part of the Platform, or license to a third party the right to
        provide the Platform, Blizzard will use reasonable commercial
        efforts to provide you with no less than three (3) months prior
        notice, unless the discontinuance arises from a matter that is
        beyond Blizzard's control or causes the provision of such
        advance notice not to be possible or feasible. If we discontinue
        a part of the Platform or Game which involves a subscription, we
        will provide you with a refund for any amounts you have paid us
        for the subscription but not yet received.

    2.  **Termination and Sanctions.** You are entitled to terminate
        this Agreement for any legitimate reason as may be specified by
        applicable law or relevant court decision, subject to prior
        written notice by contacting Blizzard Entertainment at
        <https://eu.battle.net/support/>.

         

        We are entitled to either suspend or terminate this Agreement in
        the following situations:

         

        1.  If you fail to comply with any terms contained in this
            Agreement and/or the Code of Conduct, Blizzard may provide
            you with a notice of your non-compliance and at our sole
            discretion impose a sanction. The sanction may be graduated
            depending on the violation (notably temporary/definitive
            suspension of either the Game or the Platform/Account,
            Removal of the account stats/ level rating, silence). In
            case of a serious violation of this Agreement, or the Code
            of Conduct, Blizzard will be entitled to immediately
            terminate this Agreement, the access to the Platform and/or
            any Game license without any prior warning upon
            notification. Serious violations are violations of important
            provisions which include Sections 1.A.ii.2, 1.A.iv.,
            1.B.iii., 1.C., 1.D.i.2.g., 2 and 3.B. of this Agreement or
            repeated violations of other provisions of this Agreement,
            including further non-compliance where you already have
            received a prior warning. In its sole discretion Blizzard
            may decide to replace the immediate termination of this
            Agreement with a less severe sanction or a combination of
            sanctions which can be:
            1.  A temporary suspension of the Platform/Account and/or
                the Game(s). The length of the first temporary
                suspension may vary due to the severity of the violation
                and the Game. Further, the length of the consecutive
                temporary suspensions may be progressively increased
                (each previous term is multiplied by two) in case of the
                repeated violation of the Agreement. During the
                temporary suspension the respective Account and/or the
                Game(s) will be completely inaccessible for usage. Also,
                during the temporary suspension any current paid
                subscription or game time will not be
                stopped/freezed/cancelled and is not subject to any
                claim or refund.
            2.  A removal or correction of the Account/Game's
                statistic/level(s)/rating(s) and/or in-game
                achievement(s)/title(s)/item(s), including without
                limitation, virtual currency. Such removal or correction
                may be applied not only to a disputed item/content but
                also to a group/type of items/content. For example, in
                case of violation in the person versus person mode
                ("PvP"), Blizzard may remove/correct all and any of the
                character's PvP
                statistic/level(s)/rating(s)/achievement(s)/title(s)/item(s)
                related to the respective PvP season.
            3.  "Silence" the Platform or Account or Game(s). Blizzard
                may temporary or permanently disable a possibility to
                use the Platform/Account/Game's communication tool(s)
                such as in-game text and voice chats.
        2.  In the event of any termination of this Agreement, your
            right to access and play Games will be revoked.
        3.  If you are resident in Germany, the terms set out in the
            sub-section 'Termination and Sanctions' will apply instead
            of Section 10.B.i.

11. **Right of Withdrawal.**

    1.  For the purposes of this Section 11 and Section 15, 'Services'
        will mean G ames with online-based gameplay, either downloadable
        or not, and/or other software with online-based gameplay
        (including access to such software) which are not supplied on a
        tangible form, and subscriptions to such Games. 'Content' will
        mean: (i) Game software that does not involve any aspects of
        online-based gameplay, (ii) digital in-game items, and (iii)
        funds to be uploaded as Battle.net Balance. 'Performance of the
        Service' or 'Performance of the Content' refers to the time you
        are first provided access to the Services or Content (as
        applicable) by us, which can be either right after purchase or,
        in the case of pre-orders and/or pre-purchases, when such
        Services or Content are made available.
    2.  Residents of the European Economic Area:
        1.  If you have purchased our Services, you have the right to
            withdraw from the Terms of Sale within fourteen (14)
            calendar days for any reason, subject as set out below. Your
            right to withdraw starts from the day after your purchase
            under the Terms of Sale (if you purchased the Services
            through us), or the day after your purchase under the
            third-party retailer's purchase contract (if you purchased
            the Services through a third-party retailer). Instructions
            on how to exercise this right are set out at the end of this
            Agreement in Appendix 1 (Section A: 'Information concerning
            the exercise of the right of withdrawal') and you can also
            visit <https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/186491> for
            more information or, if you purchased the Services directly
            through us and not a third-party retailer, visit
            [https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/334/1551/solution](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/334/1551/solution0)
            to exercise your right.
        2.  If the Performance of Service began prior to your withdrawal
            request, you are only entitled to a refund that is
            proportionate to the Services you've already received. For
            example, if you have already received the Services for three
            days prior to your request to withdraw, you will be entitled
            to receive a refund for the full coverage of the Services,
            minus the cost for receiving three days of Services. Your
            refund will be made no later than 14 calendar days from the
            day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw
            from the Terms of Sale or the applicable third-party
            purchase contract. If your purchase was directly through us,
            we will carry out the refund using the same means of payment
            you used for the initial transaction, unless you have
            expressly agreed otherwise. We won't charge you any fees as
            a result of this refund. If your purchase was through a
            third-party retailer, they will carry out the refund and we
            recommend contacting them for more information.
        3.  Please note you are not entitled to a refund for any
            Services which have already been fully performed prior to
            your request for withdrawal.
        4.  When you purchase Content directly from us, you hereby
            acknowledge that you lose your right of withdrawal for
            purchases of Content once Performance of the Content has
            begun. You agree that when you purchase Content directly
            from us, you request immediate performance and that you
            understand this means you will lose your statutory right to
            withdraw from the Terms of Sale. In the case of
            pre-purchases and/or pre-orders directly through us where
            the Performance of the Content has not begun, you may
            withdraw from the Terms of Sale up until the Content is made
            available for you to download or access. If you purchased
            Content through a third-party retailer (whether this relates
            to pre-purchases and/or pre-orders or otherwise), you should
            contact them for more information on your options for
            withdrawal for any purchased Content.
    3.  Residents of the United Kingdom and countries outside of the
        European Economic Area:
        1.  When you purchase Services or Content directly through us
            and receive immediate access to the Services or Content, you
            will be asked to acknowledge that this means you will lose
            your statutory right (as applicable) to withdraw from the
            Terms of Sale.
        2.  In the case of pre-purchases and/or pre-orders directly
            through us where the Performance of the Services or Content
            has not begun, you may withdraw from the Terms of Sale up
            until the Services or Content (as applicable) is made
            available for you to download or access.
        3.  For purchases of Services or Content (whether
            pre-purchases/pre-orders or otherwise) through a third-party
            retailer, please contact them for more information on your
            options for withdrawal.
    4.  Full details of Blizzard's refund practices are detailed in our
        Refund Policy. Please review our refund practices prior to
        making any purchase.

12. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction.** To the fullest extent
    permissible under applicable law, this Agreement will be governed
    and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, and
    you expressly agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for all and any
    claim or action arising out of, or relating to these Terms of Sale
    will be the courts of England and Wales. If you are resident in a
    member state of the European Union, you also enjoy the protection of
    the mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws in your
    member state.

13. **General.**

    1.  You understand and agree that the Platform may not be used,
        accessed, downloaded, or otherwise exported, reexported, or
        transferred in contravention of applicable export control,
        economic sanctions, and import laws and regulations, including,
        but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations
        ("EAR") and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of
        the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"). You
        represent and warrant that you (1) are not subject to U.S.
        sanctions or export restrictions and otherwise are eligible to
        utilize the Platform under applicable laws and regulations; (2)
        are not located or ordinarily resident in a country or region
        subject to comprehensive or near-comprehensive U.S.
        sanctions/embargo, unless your use of the Platform in such
        country or region is authorized by U.S. law; (3) are not an
        official, employee, agent, or contractor of, or directly or
        indirectly acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, a
        government (including any political subdivision, agency, or
        instrumentality thereof or any person directly or indirectly
        owned or controlled by the foregoing) or political party (e.g.,
        Cuban Communist Party, Workers' Party of Korea) subject to U.S.
        sanctions/embargo or any other entity in a sanctioned/embargoed
        country or region or subject to U.S. sanctions/embargo; and (4)
        will not use the Platform in connection with an end-use
        prohibited by U.S. law.
    2.  Blizzard may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any
        person or entity at any time with or without your consent, as
        long as the assignment does not reduce your rights under this
        Agreement. Unless you are resident in Germany, you may not
        assign this Agreement without Blizzard's prior written consent,
        and any unauthorized assignment by you will be null and void.
    3.  Blizzard's failure to enforce a provision of this Agreement will
        not be construed as a (1) waiver of such provision, or (2)
        diminishment of any right to enforce such provisions. Further,
        Blizzard may choose to waive enforcement of a provision of this
        Agreement in a particular instance; however, you are still
        obligated to comply with that waived provision in the future.

    Blizzard reserves the right to reduce, liquidate, deactivate,
    suspend or terminate any Battle.net Balance added to the Account or
    access to Battle.net Balance or other Platform features if Blizzard

    below, that you have violated this Agreement, including the license
    limitations set forth in Section 1.C., misused Battle.net Balance,
    or have otherwise used Battle.net Balance to conduct any fraudulent
    or illegal activity. We will restore any Battle.net Balance if we
    have good cause to believe our actions were not sufficiently
    justified.

     

    2.  **Patches and Updates**. The following paragraph will replace
        Sections 1.E.i. to 1.E.iii. in their entirety:
        1.  Patches and Updates: Blizzard may, if the change is solely
            for your benefit or if another valid reason exists, update
            the Platform or part of the Platform, including Games. A
            valid reason includes, for example, to:
            1.  ensure compliance with applicable laws and/or reflect
                change in relevant laws and regulatory requirements;
            2.  perform temporary maintenance, fix bugs, implement
                technical adjustments, and make improvements;
            3.  update or upgrade the Platform including updating the
                structure, design, or layout of the Platform;
            4.  balance, improve, update, or renew a Game;
            5.  ensure the security of the Platform; and
            6.  combat illegal and/or harmful activities and the use of
                unauthorized programs or other activities which breach
                this Agreement.
        2.  Unless otherwise required by applicable laws and provided
            that any such updates do not result in material derogation
            in the functionality of the Platform:
            1.  You hereby grant to Blizzard consent to deploy and apply
                such patches, updates, and modifications; and
            2.  We may update the Platform remotely without notifying
                you.
        3.  If you are resident of Germany: If any updates to the
            Platform result in negatively impacting your access or use
            of the Platform in a more than minor way, we will give you
            at least six (6) weeks' notice of such changes, and you will
            have 30 days from our notice of the change or from when the
            change comes into effect (whichever is later) to reject the
            changes and terminate the Agreement. You may also be able to
            receive a proportionate refund for any aspects of the
            Platform, including Games, paid for but not received. Please
            visit <https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/> for more
            information. If you do not object to the changes or
            terminate the Agreement within the stated time limit, we
            will take that as your acceptance of the changes.
    3.  **Modification of the Terms**. The following paragraph will
        shall replace Section 9 in its entirety:

     

    Blizzard may, from time to time, if there is a good reason for the
    change and the changes reasonably take into account the interests of
    both parties, change or modify this Agreement as its business and
    the law evolves (but we will not modify the terms to change our main
    obligations to you). Blizzard will notify you of any such changes or
    modifications by providing a notice to you. If you do not object to
    the amended Agreement within six (6) weeks following the notice,
    your continued use of the Platform will mean that you accept the
    amended Agreement. Blizzard will remind you in the notice: (i) that
    your continued use after the expiration of six (6) weeks following
    the notice means that you accept any and all changes; (ii) of your
    right to object; (iii) of the applicable notice period; and (iv) the
    legal consequences of your failure to object. Those changes or
    modifications will not affect essential characteristics of the
    Platform. Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact
    Blizzard Customer Service.

     

    4.  **Termination and Sanctions**. The following paragraph will
        shall replace Section 10.B.i in its entirety:
        1.  If you fail to comply with any terms contained in this
            Agreement and/or the Code of Conduct, Blizzard will provide
            you with a warning of your non-compliance. The sanction will
            be graduated depending on the violation (notably
            temporary/definitive suspension of either the Game or the
            Platform/Account, Removal of the account stats/ level
            rating, silence). In case of a serious violation of this
            Agreement, or the Code of Conduct, Blizzard will be entitled
            to terminate this Agreement, the access to the Platform
            and/or any Game license. We will notify you in advance if we
            decide to terminate your Agreement and/or access to the
            Platform and/or any Game license, unless the termination is
            for the purposes of complying with a legal obligation which
            does not include a prior notice obligation or this is not
            possible due to the obligation to take immediate action. We
            will restore your access to the Platform and/or any Game
            License if we have good cause to believe our actions were
            not sufficiently justified. Serious violations are
            violations of important provisions which include Sections
            1.A.ii.2, 1.A.iv., 1.B.iii., 1.C., 1.D.i.2.g., 2 and 3.B. of
            this Agreement or repeated violations of other provisions of
            this Agreement, including further non-compliance where you
            already have received a prior warning. In its sole
            discretion Blizzard may decide to replace the immediate
            termination of this Agreement with a less severe sanction or
            a combination of sanctions which can be:
            1.  A temporary suspension of the Platform/Account and/or
                the Game(s). The length of the first temporary
                suspension may vary due to the severity of the violation
                and the Game. Further, the length of the consecutive
                temporary suspensions may be progressively increased
                (each previous term is multiplied by two) in case of the
                repeated violation of the Agreement. During the
                temporary suspension the respective Account and/or the
                Game(s) will be completely inaccessible for usage. Also,
                during the temporary suspension any current paid
                subscription or game time will not be
                stopped/freezed/canceled and is not subject to any claim
                or refund.
            2.  A removal or correction of the Account/Game's
                statistic/level(s)/rating(s) and/or in-game
                achievement(s)/title(s)/item(s). Such removal or
                correction may be applied not only to a disputed
                item/content but also to a group/type of items/content.
                For example, in case of violation in the person versus
                person mode ("PvP"), Blizzard may remove/correct all and
                any of the character's PvP
                statistic/level(s)/rating(s)/achievement(s)/title(s)/item(s)
                related to the respective PvP season.
            3.  "Silence" the Platform or Account or Game(s). Blizzard
                may temporary or permanently disable a possibility to
                use the Platform/Account/Game's communication tool(s)
                such as in-game text and voice chats.

15. **Supplemental Terms - France.** If you are resident in France, the
    following terms will apply with respect to your legal guarantees for
    the Platform:

     

    French law grants you as consumers the following statutory rights
    and guarantees in relation to the Platform. Blizzard will therefore
    offer you the protection granted by law under the legal warranty of
    conformity provided by articles L. 224-25-12 to L. 224-25-26 of the
    French Consumer Code. Blizzard is liable for supplying Content and
    Services that comply with the Agreement and with the objective and
    subjective criteria set out by the law. Regarding one-off supply,
    Blizzard is accountable for any non-conformity that exists at the
    time of supply and which becomes apparent within two years of supply
    (starting from when you are first supplied the Content or Service).
    Regarding Content or Services supplied on a continuous basis,
    Blizzard is accountable for any non-conformity which becomes
    apparent during the period in which it is supplied under the
    Agreement. We are also accountable, within the same time limits, for
    any non-conformity resulting from the incorrect integration of the
    Content or Service into the consumer\'s digital environment where
    this has been done by us or under our responsibility, or where the
    incorrect integration by the consumer is the result of deficiencies
    in the instructions provided by us. For the 12 month period
    following the supply of the Platform, the consumer will not be
    required to prove the existence of the defect. In the event of lack
    of conformity, the consumer will be entitled to have the Content or
    Service brought into conformity or, failing that, to have the price
    reduced or to cancel the contract under the conditions set out in
    the French Consumer Code.
