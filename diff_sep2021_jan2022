<                 the User Content or the elements thereof in conjunction
<                 with or into any other material. You represent and
<                 warrant that the User Content does not infringe upon the

<                 intellectual property and/or personality rights of any
<                 third party. You further represent and warrant that you
<                 will not use or contribute User Content that is
<                 unlawful, tortious, defamatory, obscene, invasive of the

<                 submission in any manner it deems appropriate. Any such
<                 submission by you shall not create any contractual
<                 relationship between you and Blizzard. Except to the
<                 extent that any such waiver is prohibited by law, you
<                 hereby waive the benefit of any provision of law known
<                 as \"moral rights\" or \"droit moral\" or any similar

<                 online status. If you are a parent or legal guardian and
<                 if you provide your approval to allow your minor child
<                 to use your Account, please be aware that your child may

<                 ABLE TO SEE THE NAMES OF YOUR OTHER "REAL ID FRIENDS,"
<                 AND YOUR NAME AND ONLINE STATUS WILL BE VISIBLE BY THOSE
<                 PEOPLE THAT YOUR "REAL ID FRIENDS" HAVE DESIGNATED USING
<                 THE SAME FEATURE. You may opt out of the Real ID feature
<                 in your Batte.net Account settings at any time by
<                 deleting all Real ID Friends from your Account.
