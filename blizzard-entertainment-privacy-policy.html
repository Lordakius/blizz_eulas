recognises the importance of providing a secure environment for personal information and non-personal information (collectively “Information”). We have adopted this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain how and why we process, collect, store and use the information you provide us. This Privacy Policy does not cover Information provided when you apply for a job at Blizzard. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control activities when you click a link to other sites from a Blizzard website. We highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third-party website you may be redirected to before providing any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed within the United States or other countries where Blizzard maintains facilities or business operations (see section 6 for more information).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By using this website and/or any of Blizzard’s products or services, you acknowledge the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you object to anything described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites or play our games. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify that you acknowledge these changes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>1. Who is processing your information?</h2>
<p><strong>Blizzard Entertainment Ireland Limited</strong> is the data controller for the processing of your personal information,  a registered company located at Blackpool Retail Park, Co. Cork, Cork, Ireland.  For the performance of certain games and platform services, your information is      controlled by Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., One Blizzard Way, Irvine, CA 92618-3616, USA.  Contact information for the Data Protection Officer, for both of these companies, is located in the last section of this document.</p>
<h2>2. What information do we collect, and how long do we keep it?</h2>
<p>We collect information from or about you in the following ways:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Information provided by you.</strong> If an online visitor submits information to Blizzard, it will usually take the form of one of the following: (1) the purchase of goods or services through our online store     , (2) product or account registration, or registration for online game participation, (3) player match-up services, (4) message boards or forums, (5) eCards or Recruit-a-Friend e-mails, (6) warranty registrations, (7) contest registrations, (8) a consumer complaint, (9) surveys, (10) customer service or technical support, (11) Share WishList feature, and/or (12) newsletters. Information collected may include your name, username, home address, country of residence, phone number, date of birth, and/or e-mail address. We do not require this information to gain access to our websites, however, you will not be able to utilise certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In some very rare, specific and restricted cases, we may ask you to provide a copy partially obfuscated of a document or government-issued ID to verify your identity, location, and/or account ownership to comply with our legal obligations. When photo identification is provided to us, it is normally deleted as soon as the identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Information we get or generate from your use of our games or services.</strong> We collect information related to your game play and in-game activity, the services that you use and how you use them, and your devices and activities when you install or access our services to improve your player experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By using the speech to text accessibility feature in voice chat, you understand that your communications may be used for transcription of speech to text, including for accessibility purposes. We do not retain the chat transcription after you end the session and close the chat window.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By using the chat functionality and, when available, the voice chat functionality, you understand that Blizzard may monitor and/or record these communications to prevent cheating and fraud, or for enforcement of Blizzard’s End User Licence Agreement (EULA). Voice communication can be transcribed and analysed to detect toxic behaviour and conduct that disrupt or diminish the gaming experience for others. Blizzard will only retain the voice recording temporarily, no longer than necessary to investigate and transcribe it. Transcriptions will be retained to investigate the case and to apply sanctions, where necessary, in accordance with Blizzard’s EULA, before being deleted, except if we have a legal obligation to retain the transcription for longer. You have the choice not to use such functionality by changing your in-game settings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because voice chat and other communications may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personal information in those communications. We also retain the conversations with the Customer Support team in order to help you to solve any query you might have.
Blizzard may also monitor your computer, console, or other device (including mobile device) used to access and play games for the signatures of unauthorised programs and communicate this information back to Blizzard about that unauthorised activity to prevent cheating and fraud, and to enforce our EULA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Information collected from external sources.</strong> Blizzard may enhance or merge the personal information collected from Blizzard websites, applications, and our games with data from third-party partners and vendors, in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, improve our products, services, or systems, or for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. As such, we may receive information about you and your activities from third parties when you link your account with external accounts (such as Facebook, PlayStation, XBOX or Twitch) and from advertisers or service providers about your experiences or interactions with them. We might also obtain information about you from public sites on the internet, such as Twitch, Instagram and YouTube, to mention a few. For example, if you login to a site or app using Facebook Log In, you may be asked if you wish to share information from your Facebook account with us. If you participate in a game or other feature where your score is posted on social media content, or if you use a &quot;like&quot; or a &quot;share&quot; button for a feature on our sites or apps, then the third party may share information about you with us. For more information, please check their privacy policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We treat all information associated with your account as personal information. Blizzard collects the following categories of information depending on which product(s) or service(s) you are interested in or interacting with. We usually retain information for only as long as necessary to provide you with products, services and an immersive entertainment experience. Exceptions are noted below.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNT INFORMATION:</strong> Any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, an individual or household.

<h2>5. International Transfer</h2>
<p>Your information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. We use European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses and UK International Data Transfer Agreement to protect your information. Where we share personal information with vendors, we use these clauses, or other appropriate legal mechanisms. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review on request to our Data Protection Officer using the details set out below.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Erasure:</strong>
You may have a right to request the deletion of some of your personal information Blizzard holds about you. Blizzard is required by law to retain certain personal information.

Data portability is the ability to move your personal information from one company to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone service to another carrier).

<h2>8. What is Real ID?</h2>
<p>Real ID friends can see each other’s real-life name and can see each other’s characters across all Blizzard products and services. By participating in Blizzard’s optional Real ID system, you will make your real name visible to your friend’s friends, who will also be able to invite you to become friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you and a friend mutually agree to become Real ID friends, you will have access to a number of additional features, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real Names for Friends: Your Real ID friends will appear under their real-life names on your friends list, when chatting, communicating in-game, or viewing a character's profile.</li>
<li>Cross-Realm and Cross-Game Chat: With Real ID, friends can chat cross-realm, cross-faction, and cross-game using Blizzard’s products and services.</li>
<li>Rich Presence: You will see additional info on your friends list about what your Real ID friends are up to in Blizzard’s products and services in real time.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>9. What are tracking technologies, and how are they used?</h2>
<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners (<a href="http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/company/about/marketing-partners.html" target="_blank" rel="external">listed here</a>), may use tracking technologies like cookies, beacons, tags, scripts and unique codes used in apps. These technologies are used in analysing trends, administering the websites or apps, tracking users’ movements around the websites or apps and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual, as well as an aggregated, basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We use this technology for various purposes, including our shopping cart, maintenance of user settings (e.g. language preference) and authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use some of the features or areas of our websites may be limited. To manage your cookie settings, please click <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/cookies#settings" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personal information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies and Local Storage such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Some of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organisations who offer a single location to opt-     out of receiving tailored ads. If you wish not to have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="external">DAA's Consumer Choice page</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank" rel="external">NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads. Please also note that we strive to adhere to the <a href="http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/sites/aboutads/files/DAA_files/seven-principles-07-01-09.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising</a>.</p>

<h2>10. What are Internet Protocol addresses?</h2>
<p>An Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address is the unique number assigned to your computer. Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, country detection, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>11. What level of security is applied to your personal information?</h2>
<p>To help protect the privacy of the information and personal information you provide to us and that we learn from you, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any personal information will provide sufficient protection. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees indicated above. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>12. Note to Parents</h2>
<p>We recognise a special obligation to protect personal information about children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission when they are on line.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once a child states that his/her age is under 16 (or under 18 in the UK), he or she will be unable to register an account with us. Parents or guardians will be prompted to create a parental account and a child account for their child. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their children’s personal information, they may request the deletion of the information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:EU-Privacy@Blizzard.com" target="_blank" rel="external">EU-Privacy@Blizzard.com</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blizzard has engineered Parental Controls to help parents monitor and limit, if necessary, the amount of time their children spend interacting with our games. For more information, you may visit our Parental Controls area at <a href="https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/32243" target="_blank" rel="external">BattleNet Support</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>13. Further Information or Complaints</h2>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding your personal information protection at Blizzard, you may contact our Data Protection Officer by writing to <a href="mailto:DPO@Blizzard.com" target="_blank" rel="external">DPO@Blizzard.com</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each EU Member State and other countries shall provide one or more independent public authority (ies) to be responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal information within the Union (‘supervisory authority’), as well as the UK in application of the UK-GDPR (Data Protection Act 2018). If you feel that Blizzard has violated your rights, or if you wish to raise a concern with the data protection authorities, please contact the supervisory authority in the country where you live, work, or where you believe a breach of data protection law has occurred.</p>
