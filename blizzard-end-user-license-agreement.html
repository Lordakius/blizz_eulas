<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT (THE “AGREEMENT”) BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING BLIZZARD’S ONLINE GAMING PLATFORM. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE PLATFORM.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You must be and hereby affirm that you are an adult of the legal age of majority in your country and state of residence.  <strong>If you are under the legal age of majority, your parent or legal guardian must consent to this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in Blizzard’s online gaming services and interactive games, and the interactive games from other developers (“Licensors”) who make their games available through the Battle.net gaming service’s Platform. (Blizzard’s and the Licensors’ games are collectively referred to herein as the “Games”). This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which you are licensed to install and use the Platform, and it governs other aspects of the relationship between you and Blizzard as set forth below. As used in this Agreement, the term “Platform” refers collectively, and at times individually, to (1) the Battle.net desktop app software, (2) the Battle.net gaming service, (3) each of the Games, (4) authorized Mobile Apps relating to the Games and the Battle.net game service, and (5) all features and components of each of them, whether installed or used on a computer, console, or mobile device.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your use of the Platform is licensed, not sold, to you, and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership with respect to the Platform or the Games is being transferred or assigned and this Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights. All access to and use of the Platform and the Games is subject to this Agreement, the applicable software documentation, our <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/a4380ee5-5c8d-4e3b-83b7-ea26d01a9918/blizzard-entertainment-online-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="external">Privacy Policy</a>, any other documentation referred to in this Agreement which expressly states it is incorporated into this Agreement, and when applicable, any Licensor’s terms (collectively, the “Complete Terms”). The Complete Terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference (with this Agreement controlling any conflicting terms), and represent the complete Agreement between you and us relating to use of the Platform, the Games, and related services and products, superseding any prior Agreements between you and us, whether written or oral.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the event of conflict between this Agreement and any Licensor’s terms, see Section 1.B.v.5 below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you’ve made a purchase through Battle.net® or the Battle.net® Shop, our Terms of Sale govern such purchases and you should review those terms carefully. In any case of conflict between this Agreement and the Terms of Sale, the Terms of Sale will take precedence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Subject to the other provisions in this Agreement, this Agreement is applicable for those resident in Europe, the Middle East or Africa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided below, if you reside within Europe, Middle East or Africa and are accessing the Platform, use of the Platform is licensed to you by Activision Blizzard UK Limited,  having its registered office at The Ampersand Building, 178 Wardour Street, London, W1F 8FY, United Kingdom (referred to herein as “Blizzard”, “we,” or “us”).</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Platform.</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Battle.net Account.</strong> To use the Platform, you may be required to register, or have previously registered, a Battle.net Account (an “Account”). Certain Games may not require creation of an Account. Use of the Games, and creation and use of Accounts are subject to the following terms and conditions:
<ol>
<li>You may establish an Account only if: (i) you are a “natural person” and an adult in your country and state of residence (Corporations, Limited Liability Companies, partnerships and other legal or business entities may not establish an Account); and (ii) you are not an individual specifically prohibited by Blizzard from using the Platform.</li>
<li>When you create or update an Account, you must:
<ol>
<li>provide Blizzard with accurate and up to date information that is personal to you, such as, but not limited to, your name and email address. Additionally, in order to play certain Games or use certain features offered on the Platform, you may also be required to provide Blizzard with payment information (such as credit card information). Blizzard’s retention and/or use of your personal information is subject to Blizzard’s Privacy Policy, located at <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/8c41e7e6-0b61-42c4-a674-c91d8e8d68d3/blizzard-entertainment-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/8c41e7e6-0b61-42c4-a674-c91d8e8d68d3/blizzard-entertainment-privacy-policy</a> (the terms of which are incorporated into this Agreement). Blizzard will      also have the right to obtain non-personal data from your connection to the Platform; and</li>
<li>select a unique username and password (collectively referred to hereunder as “Login Information”). You may not use your real name as the password for the Account, and you cannot share the Account or the Login Information with anyone, unless the terms of this Agreement allow it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>To play Games, you may need to add a Game license to an Account, which may require an authentication code generated by Blizzard. For Game licenses purchased at retail, the authentication code will either be included in the packaging materials or sent to you via electronic means. If you purchase or download a Game digitally from Blizzard or via an authorized mobile app store (e.g., Apple or Google), the authentication code will be assigned to the Account when you purchase or download the Game.</li>
<li>Please take a few moments to review Blizzard’s Account Security information available here: <a href="https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/14319" target="_blank" rel="external">https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/14319</a>. You must maintain the confidentiality of the Login Information, as you are responsible for all uses of the Login Information and the Account, including purchases, whether or not authorized by you.

<p><strong>Term.</strong> This Agreement is effective upon your creation of an Account, and will      remain in effect until it is terminated or superseded by a New Agreement, or, if neither of the foregoing events occur, as long as you continue using the Platform. In the event that Blizzard chooses to cease providing the Platform, part of the Platform, or license to a third party the right to provide the Platform, Blizzard will      use reasonable commercial efforts to provide you with no less than three (3) months prior notice, unless the discontinuance arises from a matter that is beyond Blizzard’s control or causes the provision of such advance notice not to be possible or feasible. If we discontinue a part of the Platform or Game which involves a subscription, we will provide you with a refund for any amounts you have paid us for the subscription but not yet received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Termination and Sanctions.</strong> You are entitled to terminate this Agreement for any legitimate reason as may be specified by applicable law or relevant court decision, subject to prior written notice by contacting Blizzard Entertainment at <a href="https://eu.battle.net/support/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://eu.battle.net/support/</a>.</p>

<p>We are entitled to either suspend or terminate this Agreement in the following situations:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>If you fail to comply with any terms contained in this Agreement and/or the Code of Conduct, Blizzard may provide you with a notice of your non-compliance and at our sole discretion impose a sanction. The sanction may be graduated depending on the violation (notably temporary/definitive suspension of either the Game or the Platform/Account, Removal of the account stats/ level rating, silence). In case of a serious violation of this Agreement, or the Code of Conduct, Blizzard will be entitled to immediately terminate this Agreement, the access to the  Platform and/or any Game license without any prior warning upon notification. Serious violations are violations of important provisions which include Sections 1.A.ii.2, 1.A.iv., 1.B.iii., 1.C., 1.D.i.2.g., 2 and 3.B. of this Agreement or repeated violations of other provisions of this Agreement, including further non-compliance where you already have received a prior warning. In its sole discretion Blizzard may decide to replace the immediate termination of this Agreement with a less severe sanction or a combination of sanctions which can be:
<ol>
<li>A temporary suspension of the Platform/Account and/or the Game(s). The length of the first temporary suspension may vary due to the severity of the violation and the Game. Further, the length of the consecutive temporary suspensions may be progressively increased (each previous term is multiplied by two) in case of the repeated violation of the Agreement. During the temporary suspension the respective Account and/or the Game(s) will be completely inaccessible for usage. Also, during the temporary suspension any current paid subscription or game time will not be stopped/freezed/cancelled and is not subject to any claim or refund.</li>
<li>A removal or correction of the Account/Game’s statistic/level(s)/rating(s) and/or in-game achievement(s)/title(s)/item(s), including without limitation, virtual currency. Such removal or correction may be applied not only to a disputed item/content but also to a group/type of items/content. For example, in case of violation in the person versus person mode (“PvP”), Blizzard may remove/correct all and any of the character’s PvP statistic/level(s)/rating(s)/achievement(s)/title(s)/item(s) related to the respective PvP season.</li>
<li>“Silence” the Platform or Account or Game(s). Blizzard may temporary or permanently disable a possibility to use the Platform/Account/Game’s communication tool(s) such as in-game text and voice chats.</li>

</li>
<li>In the event of any termination of this Agreement, your right to access and play Games will be revoked.</li>
<li>If you are resident in Germany, the terms set out in the sub-section ‘Termination and Sanctions’ will apply instead of Section 10.B.i.</li>

<p><strong>Right of Withdrawal.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For the purposes of this Section 11 and Section 15, ‘Services’ will      mean G     ames with online-based gameplay, either downloadable or not, and/or other software with online-based gameplay (including access to such software) which are not supplied on a tangible form, and      subscriptions to such Games. ‘Content’ will mean: (i) Game software that does not involve any aspects of online-based gameplay, (ii) digital in-game items, and (iii) funds to be uploaded as Battle.net Balance. ‘Performance of the Service’ or ‘Performance of the Content’ refers to the time you are first provided access to the Services or Content (as applicable) by us, which can be either right after purchase or, in the case of pre-orders and/or pre-purchases, when such Services or Content are made available.</li>
<li>Residents of the European Economic Area:
<ol>
<li>If you have purchased our Services, you have the right to withdraw from the Terms of Sale within fourteen (14) calendar days for any reason, subject as set out below. Your right to withdraw starts from the day after your purchase under the Terms of Sale (if you purchased the Services through us), or the day after your purchase under the third-party retailer’s purchase contract (if you purchased the Services through a third-party retailer). Instructions on how to exercise this right are set out at the end of this Agreement in Appendix 1 (Section A: ‘Information concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal’) and you can also visit <a href="https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/186491" target="_blank" rel="external">https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/186491</a> for more information or, if you purchased the Services directly through us and not a third-party retailer, visit <a href="https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/334/1551/solution0" target="_blank" rel="external">https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/334/1551/solution</a> to exercise your right.</li>
<li>If the Performance of Service began prior to your withdrawal request, you are only entitled to a refund that is proportionate to the Services you’ve already received. For example, if you have already received the Services for three days prior to your request to withdraw, you will be entitled to receive a refund for the full coverage of the Services, minus the cost for receiving three days of Services. Your refund will be made no later than 14 calendar days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from the Terms of Sale  or the applicable third-party purchase contract. If your purchase was directly through us, we will carry out the refund using the same means of payment you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise.

You agree that when you purchase Content directly from us, you request immediate performance and that you understand this means you will lose your statutory right to withdraw from the Terms of Sale. In the case of pre-purchases and/or pre-orders directly through us where the Performance of the Content has not begun, you may withdraw from the Terms of Sale up until the Content is made available for you to download or access.

If you do not object to the amended Agreement within six (6) weeks following the notice, your continued use of the Platform will mean that you accept the amended Agreement. Blizzard will remind you in the notice: (i) that your continued use after the expiration of six (6) weeks following the notice means that you accept any and all changes; (ii) of your right to object; (iii) of the applicable notice period; and (iv) the legal consequences of your failure to object. Those changes or modifications will not affect essential characteristics of the Platform. Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact Blizzard Customer Service.</p>

<li><strong>Termination and Sanctions</strong>. The following paragraph will shall replace Section 10.B.i in its entirety:
<ol>
<li>If you fail to comply with any terms contained in this Agreement and/or the Code of Conduct, Blizzard will provide you with a warning of your non-compliance.  The sanction will be graduated depending on the violation (notably temporary/definitive suspension of either the Game or the Platform/Account, Removal of the account stats/ level rating, silence). In case of a serious violation of this Agreement, or the Code of Conduct, Blizzard will be entitled to terminate this Agreement, the access to the Platform and/or any Game license. We will notify you in advance if we decide to terminate your Agreement and/or access to the Platform and/or any Game license, unless the termination is for the purposes of complying with a legal obligation which does not include a prior notice obligation or this is not possible due to the obligation to take immediate action. We will restore your access to the Platform and/or any Game License if we have good cause to believe our actions were not sufficiently justified. Serious violations are violations of important provisions which include Sections 1.A.ii.2, 1.A.iv., 1.B.iii., 1.C., 1.D.i.2.g., 2 and 3.B. of this Agreement or repeated violations of other provisions of this Agreement, including further non-compliance where you already have received a prior warning. In its sole discretion Blizzard may decide to replace the immediate termination of this Agreement with a less severe sanction or a combination of sanctions which can be:
<ol>
<li>A temporary suspension of the Platform/Account and/or the Game(s). The length of the first temporary suspension may vary due to the severity of the violation and the Game. Further, the length of the consecutive temporary suspensions may be progressively increased (each previous term is multiplied by two) in case of the repeated violation of the Agreement. During the temporary suspension the respective Account and/or the Game(s) will be completely inaccessible for usage. Also, during the temporary suspension any current paid subscription or game time will not be stopped/freezed/canceled and is not subject to any claim or refund.</li>
<li>A removal or correction of the Account/Game’s statistic/level(s)/rating(s) and/or in-game achievement(s)/title(s)/item(s). Such removal or correction may be applied not only to a disputed item/content but also to a group/type of items/content. For example, in case of violation in the person versus person mode (“PvP”), Blizzard may remove/correct all and any of the character’s PvP statistic/level(s)/rating(s)/achievement(s)/title(s)/item(s) related to the respective PvP season.</li>
<li>“Silence” the Platform or Account or Game(s). Blizzard may temporary or permanently disable a possibility to use the Platform/Account/Game’s communication tool(s) such as in-game text and voice chats.</li>

<p><strong>Supplemental Terms - France.</strong>
If you are resident in France, the following terms will apply with respect to your legal guarantees for the Platform:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>French law grants you as consumers the following statutory rights and guarantees in relation to the Platform. Blizzard will therefore offer you the protection granted by law under the legal warranty of conformity provided by articles L. 224-25-12 to L. 224-25-26 of the French Consumer Code. Blizzard is liable for supplying Content and Services that comply with the Agreement and with the objective and subjective criteria set out by the law. Regarding one-off supply, Blizzard is accountable for any non-conformity that exists at the time of supply and which becomes apparent within two years of supply (starting from when you are first supplied the Content or Service). Regarding Content or Services supplied on a continuous basis, Blizzard is accountable for any non-conformity which becomes apparent during the period in which it is supplied under the Agreement. We are also accountable, within the same time limits, for any non-conformity resulting from the incorrect integration of the Content or Service into the consumer's digital environment where this has been done by us or under our responsibility, or where the incorrect integration by the consumer is the result of deficiencies in the instructions provided by us. For the 12 month period following the supply of the Platform, the consumer will not be required to prove the existence of the defect. In the event of lack of conformity, the consumer will be entitled to have the Content or Service brought into conformity or, failing that, to have the price reduced or to cancel the contract under the conditions set out in the French Consumer Code.</p>
